This a work-in-progress game based on a bunch of different ideas

**Setting**

There are numerous, seemingly unconnected scenes the player explores. Each one has a surreal feel to it. The scenes 
are not limited by normal, waking-life logic. Objects can appear and disappear at random, people can forget and know things they shouldn't be able to.

**Mechanics**

Standard first person controls.

Ability to pick up objects and view them/use them later on

Players are free to explore scenes and interact with the objects and characters within them

Scenes have a time limit corresponding to the scene's song.
