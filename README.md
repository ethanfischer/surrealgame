This is a game about meaning. More specifically, it's about how images, sounds, and various other symbols derive meaning.

As you might guess, it will involve puzzles. The player must figure out the meaning of various symbols in order to complete tasks. The answers to these puzzles
are given throughout the game, and the player should feel encouraged to pay close attention to their environment for clues.

Not coincidentally, the story also centers around meaning. One theme I hope to tease out is that the mental process that allows us to give abstract symbols meaning
is the same mental process that we use to give our own lives meaning

**Setting**

There are numerous, seemingly unconnected scenes the player explores. Each one has a surreal feel to it. Almost like a dream. The scenes 
are not limited by normal, waking logic. Objects can appear and disappear at random, people can forget and know things they shouldn't be able to.

Some potential scenes:

-You are in a kitchen and your wife asks you to make some pancakes. However, all the ingredients in the kitchen are
unknown to you. You must figure out the correct combination of ingredients, based on clues given in other scenes.

**Mechanics**

Standard first person controls.

Ability to pick up objects and view them/use them later on

Players are free to explore scenes and interact with the objects and characters within them

Interacting with characters through dialogue -- possibly multiple choice

(?)Scenes have a time limit. It usually corresponds to the scene's song. 

	--Con:this could potentially make it less fun, since it takes control away from the player. Have to experiment with this
	
	--Pro: players don't get stuck in one scene for too long and get bored if they can't make sense of it.
	
(?) Some interactions take away the player's control in a subtle, imperceptable way. If pulled off, it should feel like you unconsciously performed the action, but it still seems like it came about through your own free will. Example: you are asked to put syrup on the pancakes, and can basically draw whatever you want onto them. However, the final product ends up looking like a predetermined symbol that later becomes significant. (Idk if this is possible to pull off, gonna have to see).



**Possible puzzles**

--

--finding out a recurring character's name

--getting your wife some 'pancakes', by figuring out what pancakes means to her




**Miscellaneous details**

I don't want this to feel too analytical or challenging. Consider throwing in some 'fake puzzles' based on how well the player is doing. Getting stuck is never fun,
and as long as the player doesn't realize they being given a free pass, it should work (although, on second thought, solving a puzzle at random is arguably even
less satisfying than getting stuck.. hmmm).
--consider just sprinkling in easy puzzles then

There should be some recurring symbols/themes, in order to give more of a sense of wholeness and kind of fuck with players' minds a bit. Who doesn't love a mindfuck?

---For example, a faraway silloutte of a house that always appears in the distance

---For example, a strange old man who always seems to be staring at you

---an attractive girl who may or may not be a romantic interest
