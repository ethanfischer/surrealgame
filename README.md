This is a game, I guess, but hopefully it feels more like a weird dream in the end.

***ROUGH IDEAS BELOW***

**Overarching goal:**

Throughout the game, this recurring character keeps appearing in the scenes you visit. But for whatever reason, they will not talk to you.
Your goal is to get them speak again, by saying the 'magic words'. The challenge is to figure out what you have to say to them, based on the context clues given throughout the game.

**Setting**

There are numerous, seemingly unconnected, scenes the player explores. Each one has a surreal feel to it. Almost like, a dream. The scenes should be free to break laws of physics and logic.

Some potential scenes:

-You are in a kitchen and are told to make some pancakes. After you finish frying them, you turn around and may or may not notice that the room has changed in a subtle way (there's a door there that wasn't there before, maybe the character's face changes slightly).

**Mechanics**

Standard first person controls.

Ability to pick up objects and view them/use them later on

Players are free to explore scenes and interact with the objects and characters within them

Interacting with characters through multiple choice dialoge and freeform/type what you want (at least for the mute character)

(?)Scenes have a time limit. It usually corresponds to the scene's song. 

	--Con:this could potentially make it less fun, since it takes control away from the player. Have to experiment with this
	
	--Pro: players don't get stuck in one scene for too long and get bored if they can't make sense of it.
	
(?) Some interactions take away the player's control in a subtle, imperceptable way. If pulled off, it should feel like you unconsciously performed the action, but it still seems like it came about through your own free will. Example: you are asked to put syrup on the pancakes, and can basically draw whatever you want onto them. However, the final product ends up looking like a predetermined symbol that later becomes significant. (Idk if this is possible to pull off, gonna have to see).



**Possible sub-goals**

--piecing together a ripped apart picture or map that is somehow significant

--finding out a recurring character's name


**Miscellaneous details**

There should be some recurring symbols/themes, in order to give more of a sense of wholeness and kind of fuck with players' minds a bit. Who doesn't love a mindfuck?

---For example, a faraway silloutte of a house that always appears in the distance

---For example, a strange old man who always seems to be staring at you

---an attractive girl who may or may not be a romantic interest
