This is a game, I guess, but hopefully it feels more like a weird dream in the end.

***Ideas:***

**You have a dream journal, in which you can type in stray observations, notes, and basically whatever you want.**
--unbeknownst to the player, this actually influences the dialogue and text presented in the game.
--Your stray observations thus shape the narrative of the game in a subtle way.

**There numerous, seemingly unconnected scenes the player explores**

**Scenes have a time limit that corresponds to their associated song**

**players are free to explore scenes and interact with the objects and characters within them**
--however, they do not control the overall pace of the game. Scenes transition even if player doesn't do anything to trigger a scene change

**some possible goals (every game needs a goal, or at least some sense of direction to work towards):**
--piecing together a ripped apart picture
--finding out a recurring character's name

**recurring symbols/themes:**
--in order to fuck with the players' minds a bit, we need some 'recurring themes'. 
---For example, a faraway silloutte of a house that always appears in the distance
---For example, a strange old man who always seems to be staring at you
---an attractive girl who may or may not be a romantic interest
